# Who I am
I am a Site Reliability Engineer by day and an Open source contributor, 3D modeling/printing enthusiast, and wood worker by night.

## What does a Site Reliability Engineer do?
Currently I am essentially a fire fighter when customer facing services fail. In the future my team is moving to preventative work instead of responsive.

## What do I use the 3d printers for?
The first thing all people with 3d printers do is print parts for other 3d printers. The second is printing test chips for future reference.

Beyond that I am using them to print things for storage and parts management. Take a look at [gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) and it's most of what I am doing.

I have 3d printed my own CNC router table, feeding into the next section.

## What kind of wood working am i doing?
The goal is to automate as much of the wood working I can by having a CNC router table. The model I built is the [Low Rider 3](https://docs.v1e.com/lowrider/) by V1 Engineering.

When it's cleared off, I can fit a whole 4x8 sheet of plywood on the table. Currently it's been a better table than tool while I was working on 3d printers. I need to clear it off and calibrate the squareness.

The shop still has some of the basics like a compound sliding chop saw, table saw, and circular saw. I could do all the things the table can, but less accurate. So I will stick to only breaking down plywood sheets and cutting 2x4s with the chop saw while the table does its thing.
