A basic blog has to have some sort of content.

First thing. I don't do any of my open source work for money.

If you want to "donate" to me please make a donation to my [Extra Life](https://el.pvcp.co/) page. The URL redirects to my page and I keep it updated.

just because I am running a blog doesn't mean that I will have this updated on an regular basis. If anything this will be a dumping ground for stuff that I have figured out and wanted to share.

As a first post I wanted to have at least something to show for setting this up.

I do have some things to share as people have asked about my setup I have for my personal server stuff I have at home. Look forward to that showing up at some point in the next few days. I may even have images.
